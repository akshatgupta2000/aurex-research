# Auto Sector Driver-Based DCF Valuation Model  
**By Akshat Gupta | Aurex Research**

## 📌 Overview
This project is a comprehensive, driver-based **3-statement financial model with FCFF DCF valuation** built for the Indian Auto sector company TATA Motors & SPV.  
The model integrates operational drivers, dynamic capital structure assumptions, sensitivity analysis, and multi-variable stress testing to estimate intrinsic value and assess valuation risk under different scenarios.

It is designed to replicate an **equity research / fundamental analysis style model** used in professional valuation and strategy settings.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a fully integrated **Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow** model.
- Transition from simple assumption-based forecasting to **driver-based modeling**.
- Implement a robust **FCFF DCF framework** with dynamic WACC and terminal value.
- Analyze valuation risk using **sensitivity and stress testing**.
- Present outputs through a clean **dashboard** for decision-making.

## 🧱 Model Structure
The workbook is organized into modular sheets for clarity and scalability:

- **Control** – Model settings and validated inputs.  
- **Assumptions** – Core base assumptions and forecast setup.  
- **Revenue_Drivers** – Driver-based revenue growth framework.  
- **Operating_Costs** – EBITDA margin and cost structure.  
- **Working_Capital** – Inventory, receivables, payables drivers.  
- **Capex_Depreciation** – Capex intensity and depreciation schedules.  
- **Debt_Interest** – Simplified debt balance and interest estimation.  
- **Income_Statement** – Forecasted IS.  
- **Balance_Sheet** – Integrated BS with plugs and checks.  
- **Cash_Flow** – Indirect CF with FCFF computation.  
- **WACC** – Dynamic cost of capital build-up.  
- **DCF_Valuation** – FCFF valuation, terminal value, equity bridge.  
- **Sensitivity** – 2D sensitivity to WACC and terminal growth.  
- **Stress_Test** – Multi-variable scenario analysis.  
- **Output_Dashboard** – Summary view of valuation, assumptions, and scenarios.  
- **Checks** – Balance and consistency validations.

## 🧮 Key Features
- ✅ Driver-based forecasting for revenue, margins, capex, and working capital.  
- ✅ Fully integrated 3-statement model.  
- ✅ FCFF-based DCF valuation using WACC.  
- ✅ Dynamic terminal value with long-term growth.  
- ✅ Sensitivity analysis (WACC × terminal g heatmap).  
- ✅ Stress testing across growth, margins, capex, WC, WACC, and g.  
- ✅ Scenario-driven dashboard for clear outputs.  
- ✅ Built-in checks for model integrity.

## 📊 Output Highlights
The model produces:
- **Intrinsic value per share** and **upside/downside vs CMP**.  
- Key assumption snapshot for selected scenarios.  
- Valuation range through sensitivity and stress testing.  
- Interpretation box summarizing key insights.

This allows quick understanding of:
> *What the business is worth, why, and what could go wrong.*

## 🧠 Key Learnings from This Project

This model represents a major step-up from my earlier work. Key learnings include:

- Transition from **static assumptions** to **true driver-based forecasting**.
- Understanding the importance of **working capital and reinvestment** in value creation.
- Building a **dynamic WACC** instead of using fixed discount rates.
- Linking valuation to operational reality through **stress testing**.
- Structuring large models with **modular design** for scalability.
- Presenting results via a **dashboard**, not just raw sheets.
- Appreciating the role of **checks, governance, and formatting** in professional models.

## 🔄 Comparison with My Earlier Models

| Earlier Models (Beginner) | Current Model (This Project) |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|
Single-sheet or loosely linked models | Fully integrated 3-statement structure |
Static growth assumptions | Driver-based revenue & margin forecasting |
Basic DCF with hard-coded WACC | Dynamic WACC build-up |
No working capital detail | Full WC schedules (inventory, AR, AP) |
Limited or no sensitivity | Full sensitivity & stress testing |
Outputs buried in sheets | Clean Output Dashboard |
Minimal checks | Dedicated Checks sheet |
Focus on getting numbers | Focus on **framework & logic** |

This project marks my transition from **“making Excel work”** to **“building valuation frameworks.”**

## ⚖️ Valuation Approach

- **Method:** FCFF DCF  
- **Discount Rate:** WACC  
- **Terminal Value:** Gordon Growth Method  
- **Equity Value:** Enterprise Value – Net Debt  
- **Focus:** Long-term fundamentals, not short-term price targets.

> The model assumes a relatively stable capital structure; valuation is independent of the debt path and is based on FCFF discounted at WACC.

---

## 🚧 Limitations & Future Enhancements
- Debt schedule is simplified; future versions can include cash-driven repayments and new borrowings.
- No explicit dividend or FCFE modeling yet.
- Monte Carlo or probabilistic valuation can be added later.
- Sector and company-level peer benchmarking can be integrated.

## 📁 How to Use
1. Open the workbook.
2. Start at **Control** and **Output_Dashboard**.
3. Review base case assumptions.
4. Use scenario analysis and sensitivity to explore valuation range.
5. Dive into individual sheets for detailed drivers and logic.
