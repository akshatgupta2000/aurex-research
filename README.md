## 📌 About Aurex Research

**Aurex Research** is an independent financial research and education initiative focused on  
**data-driven analysis, valuation frameworks, ROCE/quality models, and long-form writing** on markets and businesses.

The goal is to bridge:  
**financial statements → structured models → clear written insights.**

Through Aurex Research, I:
- build analyst-grade financial and valuation models,  
- design dashboards and analytical frameworks, and  
- publish blogs and case-style articles to explain *how to think* about value creation, risk, and long-term fundamentals.

This repository serves as the central hub for the **models, visuals, and documents** that support that research and writing.

A **ROCE-driven compounding framework** comparing two FMCG leaders to study how capital efficiency converts into long-term cash flows and intrinsic value.

**Key features:**
- Driver-based growth, margin & reinvestment modeling  
- Capital employed build-up (PPE + working capital + operating assets)  
- ROCE → FCFF → DCF valuation linkage  
- Integrated 3-statement structure  
- Sensitivity & scenario stress testing  
- One-page premium **ROCE Compounding Dashboard**  
- Robust internal consistency **Checks**  
- Optimized terminal value share (~75–80% of EV)

## ✍️ Writing & Blogs

Alongside building models, I regularly write about:
- valuation frameworks & financial mental models,  
- sector performance and outlook,  
- financial modeling concepts, and  
- case-style market analysis.

These articles translate the analysis in this repository into **clear, educational insights**.
