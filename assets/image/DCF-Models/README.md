# Financial Models & Dashboards  
**Aurex Research | By Akshat Gupta**

---

## 📌 Overview

This folder contains visual outputs (dashboards, sensitivity charts, and model snapshots) from the **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation frameworks** built under *Aurex Research*.

These models are designed to replicate **analyst-grade valuation workflows**, combining:

- Driver-based forecasting  
- Integrated financial statements  
- FCFF-based DCF valuation  
- Sensitivity and scenario analysis  
- Clean output dashboards for interpretation  

The images here are used to showcase results and structure from the underlying Excel models.

## 📂 What You’ll Find Here

This directory includes dashboard and output snapshots from multiple projects, such as:

### 🔹 Auto Sector – Driver-Based DCF Model
- Integrated 3-statement FCFF DCF framework  
- Dynamic WACC build-up  
- WACC × terminal growth sensitivity heatmap  
- Multi-variable stress testing  
- Scenario-driven valuation dashboard  

### 🔹 FMCG ROCE Compounding Model – HUL vs ITC
- ROCE → FCFF → DCF valuation linkage  
- Capital efficiency and reinvestment-driven framework  
- Dual-company comparison dashboards  
- Scenario and sensitivity-based valuation outputs  
- One-page premium ROCE compounding dashboard  

### 🔹 LBO + DCF Transaction Model (IT Services Case)
- Integrated FCFF DCF + LBO framework in a single workbook
- Entry valuation with funding mix (Debt/Equity) and transaction fees
- Cash-flow–driven debt paydown schedule with leverage tracking
- Exit valuation using EV/EBITDA multiple and equity bridge
- Returns analysis: MOIC & Equity IRR across scenarios
- Premium LBO Transaction Summary Dashboard with visuals

### 🔹 Valuation Dashboard - Deterministic & Probabilistic View
- Operating model linking **growth, profitability, reinvestment, and FCFF**
- Explicit focus on **economic value drivers** instead of accounting statements
- **Monte Carlo simulation** to model uncertainity across key assumptions
- **Percentile-based WACC x g sensitivity surface** built from simulated outcomes
- Clean, analyst-grade **Output Dashboard** summarizing risk, dispersion, and valuation robustness

### 🔹 Monte Carlo Valuation - Distribution & Risk View
- End-to-end operating-model–linked valuation framework, integrating FCFF-based DCF with probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation
- Distribution-aware valuation engine capturing uncertainty across growth, margins, reinvestment, ROIC, WACC, and terminal assumptions
- Dedicated Model Health & Governance layer to validate valuation logic, simulation integrity, and economic consistency
- Scenario-agnostic design enabling risk-reward assessment beyond point estimates, including downside, dispersion, and value drivers
- Research-grade structure, aligned with published academic and practitioner work (SSRN & independent research publications)
- Fully modular, extensible architecture suitable for advanced equity research, strategy, and capital allocation analysis

The project highlights **probabilistic thinking and valuation fragility,** offering a structured approach to understanding long-term value under uncertainity.
  
*(Additional sector DCF models will be added over time.)*

## 🧮 Key Features Reflected in the Outputs

Across the models, the dashboards highlight:

- Intrinsic value per share and upside/downside
- Key operating and valuation assumptions
- ROCE, growth, and cash flow trends
- Sensitivity to WACC and terminal growth
- Stress test outcomes across scenarios
- Transaction metrics (MOIC, IRR, leverage, equity bridge)
- Interpretation of the primary value drivers
- Monte Carlo simulation engine & fragility model

These visuals summarize the economic story behind each valuation.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

The goal of this folder is to:

- Provide quick visual insight into model outputs  
- Support blog posts, case studies, and documentation  
- Showcase dashboard design and presentation quality  
- Help reviewers understand the structure before opening full models  

For detailed logic and calculations, refer to the main Excel workbooks in the project root.
