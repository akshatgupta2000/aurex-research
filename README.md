## 📌 About Aurex Research
**Aurex Research** is an independent financial research and education initiative focused on **data-driven analysis, valuation frameworks, and long-form writing** on markets and businesses.

The goal is to bridge:  
**financial statements → structured models → clear written insights.**

Through Aurex Research, I:
- build analyst-grade financial models,  
- develop dashboards and analytical frameworks, and  
- publish blogs and case-style articles to explain *how to think* about value creation, risk, and long-term fundamentals.

This repository serves as the central hub for the **models, visuals, and documents** that support that research and writing.
